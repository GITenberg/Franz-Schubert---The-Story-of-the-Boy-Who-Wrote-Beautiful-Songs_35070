<p class="h2">HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</p>

<hr />

<p class="noindent">THIS book is one of a series known as the CHILD'S OWN
BOOK OF GREAT MUSICIANS, written by Thomas
Tapper, author of "Pictures from the Lives of the Great Composers
for Children," "Music Talks with Children," "First
Studies in Music Biography," and others.</p>

<p>The sheet of illustrations included herewith is to be cut
apart by the child, and each illustration is to be inserted in its
proper place throughout the book, pasted in the space containing
the same number as will be found under each picture on the
sheet. It is not necessary to cover the entire back of a picture
with paste. Put it only on the corners and place neatly within
the lines you will find printed around each space. Use photographic
paste, if possible.</p>

<p>After this play-work is completed there will be found at
the back of the book blank pages upon which the child is to
write his own story of the great musician, based upon the facts
and questions found on the previous pages.</p>

<p>The book is then to be sewed by the child through the
center with the cord found in the enclosed envelope. The book
thus becomes the child's own book.</p>

<p>This series will be found not only to furnish a pleasing and
interesting task for the children, but will teach them the main
facts with regard to the life of each of the great musicians&mdash;an
educational feature worth while.</p>

<hr />

<p>This series of the Child's Own Book of Great Musicians
includes at present a book on each of the following:</p>

<p>One might say of Schubert that he was born

<p>Schubert composed many kinds of music, but
his songs are most loved by everybody.</p>

<p>They are sung all over the world.</p>

<p>And just because he never let a song come from
his lips that did not first come from his heart.</p>

Schubert's full name was FRANZ PETER
SCHUBERT.</p>

<p>He was born in Vienna, in a very simple house
that looks quite old-fashioned.</p>

<p>Over the doorway there is a bust of Schubert, a
few inches high.</p>

<p>And a sign on the house says: Franz Schubert's
Birthplace.</p>

<img src="images/illus04.png" alt="No. 4" title="No. 4" /><br />
<span class="caption">FRANZ SCHUBERT&#39;S BIRTHPLACE.</span>
</div>

<p>Dates are easy to remember if we write them.
So you must ask your teacher when Schubert was
born and put in the date in the next sentence.</p>

<p>Franz Schubert was born in.........</p>

<p>At that time the great American authors Washington
Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, and William
Cullen Bryant were all boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
You may not know so much about them now,
but some day they will be quite as good friends as
any you will ever make.</p>

<p>Even though these boys were a little older than
Franz Schubert, let us always think of them together.</p>

<p>Then, of course, we should think of Schubert
together with the composers who lived when he did.</p>

<p>Here are some whose names you can remember
very easily.</p>

<span class="caption">DONIZETTI.</span>
</div>

<p>Czerny was born in the year 1794, and wrote
many studies for the piano.</p>

<p>How much older was he than Franz Schubert?</p>

<p>Von Weber wrote operas and conducted them
himself. He was born eleven years before Schubert.</p>

<p>Rossini was an Italian composer of operas, born
in 1792, five years before Schubert. Schubert's life
was so short, however, that Rossini lived forty years
longer than the great song writer.</p>

<p>Donizetti was an Italian opera composer. One
of his well-known operas was Lucia di Lammermoor.
He was born in 1797, just as Schubert was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
Franz's father was a schoolmaster, and so was
Franz himself for three years.</p>

<p>He taught the little children of Vienna their A-B-C's,
and how to do sums. Of course, he helped
them to learn to read.</p>

<p>Sometimes we find it quite hard to take one
piano lesson or violin lesson a week.</p>

<p>But from the time when Franz Schubert was a
very little boy he had lessons every week for violin,
voice, and piano.</p>

<p>A little later he began to study harmony with a
very famous man who knew
Mozart. His name was
ANTONIO SALIERI.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus12.png" alt="No. 12" title="No. 12" /><br />
<span class="caption">ANTONIO SALIERI.</span>
</div>

<p>With so many lessons
and with school work just
as we have it, Franz must
have been a very busy
boy.</p>

<p>He was quite poor and
often very hungry; but in
spite of that he was always good natured and full
of fun.</p>

<p>At eleven years of age he became a singer in the
chapel of the Emperor. It was here that Salieri was
director.</p>

<p>Franz sang in the choir until he was nearly seventeen.
Then he became a schoolmaster, because,
of course, he had to earn his living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
Wherever he was
Franz was thinking
music and composing it.
Once he wrote a song
called <i>The Serenade</i> at a
table outside an inn.</p>

<p>An artist has made
a picture of this.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus13.png" alt="No. 13" title="No. 13" /><br />
<span class="caption">SCHUBERT WRITING &quot;THE SERENADE.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Once Schubert was
seen by his boyhood
friends busily writing a
new song. So quick did he write that the ink was
hardly dry on one sheet before the next one was done.
He was writing the music to a beautiful fairy poem
by the great German poet Goethe. The poem is
called <i>The Erl-King</i>, and tells how the fairy Erl-King
chases a father who is rushing on horseback with
his dying child in his arms.
Finally, just as the father reaches
his courtyard the child dies. It
is a beautiful song sung by the
greatest singers.</p>

<p>Goethe, the great poet, is
not known to have met Schubert.
He paid little attention to his
music.</p>

<p>Here is his picture.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus14.png" alt="No. 14" title="No. 14" /><br />
<span class="caption">JOHANN WOLFGANG GOETHE.</span>
</div>

<p>Sometime you will learn about Joseph Haydn,
who died in Vienna when little Franz was twelve
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
years old. Papa Haydn, as he was called, was music
master in a famous family called the Esterhazys.</p>

<p>Let us put a picture of Joseph Haydn here just
to remember that he was an old man of seventy-seven
when little Franz was a boy of twelve.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus15.png" alt="No. 15" title="No. 15" /><br />
<span class="caption">JOSEPH HAYDN.</span>
</div>

<p>Well, Franz Schubert also lived for a time with
the Esterhazy family. He was piano teacher to the
children of Count Johann. Franz was then twenty-one
years old.</p>

<p>In what year was he twenty-one?</p>

<p>A good friend of Schubert's was Michael Vogl.
He was a famous singer, who did all he could to
make Schubert's songs known.</p>

<p>They took little vacation trips together and were
good companions. When you read more about this
singer's friendship for Franz Schubert you will like
him for being so kind to one who had very little
pleasure in life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
He looks like a good friend even in a picture&mdash;do
you not think so?</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus16.png" alt="No. 16" title="No. 16" /><br />
<span class="caption">SCHUBERT ACCOMPANYING VOGL AS HE SINGS.</span>
</div>

<p>Once when Schubert and Vogl were enjoying a
vacation tour in the mountains, Franz read Scott's
<i>Lady of the Lake</i>, which was printed in the year
1810, when Schubert was thirteen years old.</p>

<p>Schubert set some of this poem to music. A
fact you will remember when you read it in school.</p>

<p>Perhaps you could remember at the same time
that Scott was a little older than Schubert and just
one year younger than Beethoven.</p>

<p>Beethoven lived in Vienna at that time and
Schubert with two friends went to see him. Beethoven
was very deaf, and those who met him had
to write down what they wanted to say with a large
pencil, such as is used by carpenters. Schubert was
so modest and nervous upon meeting the great master
that he could not even write his replies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
Here is the picture of the way Beethoven looked
as he walked down the street in those days:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus17.png" alt="No. 17" title="No. 17" /><br />
<span class="caption">BEETHOVEN IN VIENNA.</span>
</div>

<p>Once when Schubert was very ill a friend sent
him some books to read. They were <i>The Last of the
Mohicans</i>, <i>The Spy</i>, <i>The Pilot</i>, and <i>The Pioneer</i>.</p>

<p>Now these books were written by the American
author, whose name you must find for yourself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus18.png" alt="No. 18" title="No. 18" /><br />
<span class="caption">SCHUBERT&#39;S WORK ROOM.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
See what a simple work room Schubert had.
Here are his Clavier and chair and a few books.</p>

<p>Schubert had music in his mind and soul all the
time. It is said that one of his favorite walks was
down by a mill, where he was inspired to write some
beautiful songs.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg

Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
